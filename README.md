# TripleTen_StatisticalDataAnalysis

This project involves conducting a preliminary analysis for the telecom operator Megaline, which offers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department is seeking to understand which plan generates more revenue in order to inform advertising budget decisions.

The analysis is based on a dataset of 500 Megaline clients, including information on customer demographics, geographic location, plan type, and their usage behavior in 2018 (such as the number of calls made and text messages sent). The goal is to examine client behavior and determine which of the two prepaid plans is more profitable for the company.
